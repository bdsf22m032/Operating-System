Spinning Disk (HDD):
          It uses magnetic platters to store data, with a moving read-write head.
It performannce is low due to mechanical parts.It cost per GB is less than SSD and provide more storage facility with minimum price.It produces heat and noise due to moving of mechanical parts inside it.

Solid State Disk (SSD):
	   IT stores data on flash memory chips, with no moving parts thats why it is working faster than HDD because of having no mechanical parts.It is costly per GB than HDD but is more durable and use less power and operates silently.


Q NO : 02))

Logical Block Addressing (LBA): 
	   LBA is a way in which computers organize and access data on a hard disk. Instead of using the physical layout of the disk like cylinders, heads, and sectors.LBA gives each data block a unique number which makes it easier to manage data without worrying about the hardware structure.

24 bit LBA -----> 2^24 blocks  and maximum size is (2^24 * 512 bytes) about 8.4 GB
28 bit LBA -----> 2^28 blocks  and maximum size is (2^28 * 512 bytes) about 137 GB



Q N0 : 03))

Hard Disk Interface :
		It is the connection between a hard disk drive and a computer motherboard. It acts as a communication bridge that transferring the data back and forth between the storage device and the system. 

Imporatant Features of HDD interfaces:

1 : ATA/IDE/PATA (Parallel ATA) :
		Speed: Up to 133 MB/s.
		Size: Bulky ribbon cables (40 cm)
		Pins : 40 on connector
		Connections: Supports up to 2 devices per cable.
		Hot-Pluggable: No.

2: SATA (Serial ATA):
		Speed: Up to 6 Gbps
		Size: Slim cables for better airflow (1-m)
		Pins: 7 pins for data and 15 pins for power
		Connections: One device per port
		Hot-Pluggable: Yes
3: SCSI (Small Computer System Interface):
		Speed: Up to 640 MB/s 
		Size: Moderately large cables.(6-m)
		Pins: 50, 68, or 80 pins 
		Connections: up to 1
		Hot-Pluggable: Yes

CHS stands for Cylinders, Heads, and Sectors, which are used to organize and locate data on older hard disks

Reading:
	The computer sends a request with the cylinder, head, and sector where the data is stored.
	The disk arm moves to the correct cylinder or track.
	The head reads data from the correct sector as the disk rotates.
Writing:
	The arm moves to the correct cylinder.
	The head writes data to the specified sector.

Seek Time :
	The time takes by the disk arm to move to the correct cylinder.

Rotational Delay:
	The time it takes for the disk to spin and align the correct sector under the read/write head.


How CHS Mapping to LBA Reduces Seek Time ?
	      In CHS the system finds data by moving the disk arm to the right cylinder and waiting for the sector to spin under the head, which takes time. LBA  simplifies this by assigning each block a unique number, so the system doesnâ€™t need to calculate specific cylinder, head, or sector positions. This makes data access faster by reducing both seek time and rotational delay.



Linux

Partition Type Number: 83
Used for standard Linux file systems (e.g., ext4, ext3).
Windows NTFS

Partition Type Number: 07
Used for Windows operating systems, especially for NTFS file systems.
Linux Swap

Partition Type Number: 82
Used for swap partitions in Linux systems, which act as virtual memory.
FAT32

Partition Type Number: 0B
Used for partitions formatted with the FAT32 file system, commonly used in removable media and older Windows systems.
EFI System Partition (ESP)

Partition Type Number: EF
Used in UEFI-based systems to store boot-related files.

File System:
A file system is a method for storing, organizing, and managing files on a storage device, allowing users and programs to retrieve, update, or delete data.

Journaling File System:
A journaling file system logs changes to files and directories before they are made, ensuring quick recovery and consistency after crashes or power failures.

Functionalities of a Good File System:
Data Storage and Retrieval
File Management
Security and Access Control
Reliability
Efficiency
Consistency
Support for Large Files and Volumes
Scalability
